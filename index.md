# Brijesh Singh

I am a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/). Presently, I am working in area of Computer Vision and Image Processing under the joint supervision of [Dr. Arijit Sur](https://www.iitg.ac.in/arijit/) and [Dr. Pinaki Mitra](https://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/internet-pages/pinaki).

### Research Interest

My research interest includes- Computer vision, Image processing. Currentlly, I am working on Steganography and Steganalysis using Deep Learning.



### Coding Skills

- Tensorflow
- Pyotrch
- Matlab

### My Implementations of Existing Steganalysis models

- *Deep Residual Network for Steganalysis of Digital Images* (**SRNet**) [Pytorch code](https://github.com/brijeshiitg/Steganalysis-Models-Implementation/tree/master)
- ***ReST-Net**: Diverse Activation Modules and Parallel Subnets-Based CNN for Spatial Image Steganalysis* [Pytorch code]()
- 

### Publication

- *A New Steganalysis Method using Densely Connected Convnets*, **Brijesh Singh**, Prasen Kumar Sharma, Rupal Saxena, Arijit Sur, and Pinaki Mitra. In 8th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (2019), Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) ~~[Pytorch code]()~~
