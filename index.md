# Brijesh Singh

I am a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/). Presently, I am working in area of Computer Vision and Image Processing under the joint supervision of [Dr. Arijit Sur](https://www.iitg.ac.in/arijit/) and [Dr. Pinaki Mitra](https://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/internet-pages/pinaki).
