# Brijesh Singh

I am a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/). Presently, I am working in area of Computer Vision and Image Processing under the joint supervision of [Dr. Arijit Sur](https://www.iitg.ac.in/arijit/) and [Dr. Pinaki Mitra](https://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/internet-pages/pinaki).

### Research Interest

My research interests includes- Computer vision, Image processing. 
Currently, I am working on Steganography and Steganalysis using Deep Learning.



### Coding Skills

- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
- [Pyotrch](https://pytorch.org/)
- Matlab

### My Implementations of Existing Steganalysis models

- *Deep Learning for Steganalysis via Convolutional Neural Networks* (**GNCNN**) [[code](https://github.com/brijeshiitg/GNCNN-Deep_learning_for_steganalysis_via_convolutional_neural_networks)]

- *Deep Residual Network for Steganalysis of Digital Images* (**SRNet**) [[code](https://github.com/brijeshiitg/Steganalysis-Models-Implementation/tree/master)]

- ***ReST-Net**: Diverse Activation Modules and Parallel Subnets-Based CNN for Spatial Image Steganalysis* [[code]()]

### Publications
